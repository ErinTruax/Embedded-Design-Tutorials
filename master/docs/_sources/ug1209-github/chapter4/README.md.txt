# Boot and Configuration

This chapter shows integration of components to create a Zynq&reg;
 UltraScale+&trade; system. The purpose of this chapter is to understand how
 to integrate and load boot loaders, bare-metal applications (for
 APU/RPU), and Linux Operating System for a Zynq UltraScale+ system.

 The following important points are covered in this chapter:

-  System Software: FSBL, U-Boot, Arm&reg; trusted firmware (ATF)

-  Application Processing Unit (APU): Configure SMP Linux for APU

-   Real-time Processing Unit (RPU): Configure Bare-metal for RPU in
     Lock-step

- Create Boot Image for the following boot sequence:

  1. APU

  2. RPU Lock-step

-  Create and load Secure Boot Image

 >***Note*:** For more information on RPU Lock-step, see *Zynq
 UltraScale+ Device Technical Reference Manual* ([UG1085](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/ndoc?t=user_guides%3Bd%3Dug1085-zynq-ultrascale-trm.pdf)).

 This boot sequence also includes loading the PMU Firmware for the
 Platform Management Unit (PMU). The Vitis IDE and PetaLinux can be
 used to create boot images to fulfill different boot requirements.
 While [Chapter 3: Build Software for PS Subsystems](#chapter-3)
 focused only on creating software blocks for each processing unit in
 the PS, this chapter explains how these blocks can be loaded as a part
 of a bigger system.

 To create a boot image, use the Create Boot Image wizard (Bootgen
 command line tool). The principle function of the Create Boot Image
 wizard or Bootgen is to integrate the partitions (hardware-bitstream
 and software) and allow you to specify the security options in the
 design. It can also create cryptographic keys. Functionally, Bootgen
 uses a Bootgen Image Format (BIF) file as an input, and generates a
 single file image in binary BIN or MCS format. Bootgen outputs a
 single file image which is loaded into NVM (QSPI, SD Card). The
 Bootgen GUI facilitates the creation of the BIF input file.

 This chapter makes use of Processing System block. [Design Example 1:
 Using GPIOs, Timers,
 and](#design-example-1-using-gpios-timers-and-interrupts)
 [Interrupts](#design-example-1-using-gpios-timers-and-interrupts)
 covers boot image which will include the PS partitions used in this
 chapter and a bitstream targeted for PL fabric.

## System Software

 The following system software blocks cover most of the Boot and
 Configuration for this chapter. For detailed boot flow and various
 Boot sequences, refer to the "System Boot and Configuration" chapter
 in the *Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC: Software Developers Guide*
 ([UG1137](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/rdoc?v=latest%3Bd%3Dug1137-zynq-ultrascale-mpsoc-swdev.pdf)).

### First Stage Boot Loader

 In non-secure boot mode, the platform management unit (PMU) releases
 the reset of the configuration security unit, and enters the PMU
 server mode to monitor power. At this stage the configuration security
 unit loads the first stage boot loader (FSBL) into on-chip memory
 (OCM). The FSBL can be run from either APU A53_0 or RPU R5_0 or RPU
 R5_lockstep. In this example, the FSBL is targeted for APU Cortex&trade;-A53
 Core 0. The last 512 bytes of this region is used by FSBL to share the
 hand-off parameters corresponding to applications which ATF hands off.

 The First Stage Boot Loader initializes important blocks in the
 processing subsystem. This includes clearing the reset of the
 processors, initializing clocks, memory, UART, and so on before
 handing over the control of the next partition in DDR, to either RPU
 or APU. In this example, the FSBL loads bare-metal application in DDR
 and hands off to RPU Cortex-R5F in Lockstep mode, and similarly loads
 U-Boot to be executed by APU Cortex-A53 Core-0. For more information,
 see the *Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC: Software Developers Guide*
 ([UG1137](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/rdoc?v=latest%3Bd%3Dug1137-zynq-ultrascale-mpsoc-swdev.pdf)).

 For this chapter, you can use the FSBL executable that you created in
 [Chapter 3: Build Software](#chapter-3) [for PS
 Subsystems](#chapter-3). In FSBL application, the
 xfsbl_translation_table.S differs from translation_table.S (of
 Cortex-A53) in only one aspect, to mark DDR region as reserved. This
 is to avoid speculative access to DDR before it is initialized. Once
 the DDR initialization is done in FSBL, memory attributes for DDR
 region is changed to "Memory" so that it is cacheable.

### Platform Management Unit Firmware

 The platform management unit (PMU) and the configuration security unit
 manage and perform the multi-staged booting process. The PMU primarily
 controls the pre-configuration stage that executes PMU ROM to set up
 the system. The PMU handles all of the processes related to reset and
 wake-up. The Vitis IDE provides PMU Firmware that can be built to run
 on the PMU. For more details on the Platform Management and PMU
 Firmware, see the *Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC: Software Developers Guide*
 ([UG1137](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/rdoc?v=latest%3Bd%3Dug1137-zynq-ultrascale-mpsoc-swdev.pdf)).

 The PMU Firmware can be loaded in the following ways:

1. Using BootROM to load PMU Firmware, as described in [Boot Sequence
     for SD-Boot](#boot-sequence-for-sd-boot).

2. Using FSBL to load PMU Firmware, as described in [Boot Sequence for
     QSPI Boot Mode](#boot-sequence-for-qspi-boot-mode).

3. Loading PMU Firmware in JTAG boot mode, as described in [Boot
     Sequence for QSPI-Boot Mode Using
     JTAG](#boot-sequence-for-qspi-boot-mode-using-jtag).

 For more information, see the [PMU Firmware Xilinx
 Wiki](http://www.wiki.xilinx.com/PMU%2BFirmware).

### U-Boot

 The U-Boot acts as a secondary boot loader. After the FSBL handoff,
 the U-Boot loads Linux on Arm&reg; Cortex-A53 APU. After FSBL, the U-Boot
 configures the rest of the peripherals in the processing system based
 on board configuration. U-Boot can fetch images from different memory
 sources like eMMC, SATA, TFTP, SD, and QSPI. For this example, U-Boot
 and all other images are loaded from the SD card. Therefore, for this
 example, the board will be set to SD-boot mode.

 U-Boot can be configured and built using the PetaLinux tool flow. For
 this example, you can use the U-Boot image that you created in
 [Chapter 3: Build Software for PS Subsystems](#chapter-3) or from the
 design files shared with this document. See [Design Files for This
 Tutorial](#design-files-for-this-tutorial) for information about
 downloading the design files for this tutorial.

### Arm Trusted Firmware

 The Arm Trusted Firmware (ATF) is a transparent bare-metal application
 layer executed in Exception Level 3 (EL3) on APU. The ATF includes a
 Secure Monitor layer for switching between secure and non-secure
 world. The Secure Monitor calls and implementation of Trusted Board
 Boot Requirements (TBBR) makes the ATF layer a mandatory requirement
 to load Linux on APU on Zynq UltraScale+.

 The FSBL loads ATF to be executed by APU, which keeps running in EL3
 awaiting a service request. The ATF starts at 0xFFFEA000. The FSBL
 also loads U-Boot in DDR to be executed by APU, which loads Linux OS
 in SMP mode on APU. It is important to note that the PL bitstream
 should be loaded before ATF is loaded. The reason is FSBL uses the OCM
 region which is reserved for ATF for holding a temporary buffer in the
 case where bitstream is present in .BIN file. Because of this, if
 bitstream is loaded after ATF, FSBL will overwrite the ATF image with
 its temporary buffer, corrupting ATF image. Hence, bitstream should be
 positioned in .BIF before ATF and preferably immediately after FSBL
 and PMU Firmware.

 The ATF (`bl31.elf`) is built by default in PetaLinux and can be found
 in the PetaLinux Project images directory.

 For more details on ATF, refer to the "Arm Trusted Firmware" section
 in the "Security" chapter of the *Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC: Software
 Developers Guide*
 ([UG1137](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/rdoc?v=latest%3Bd%3Dug1137-zynq-ultrascale-mpsoc-swdev.pdf)).

## Linux on APU and Bare-Metal on RPU

 Now that the system software is configured, create Linux Images using
 PetaLinux tool flow. You already created the PetaLinux images in
 [Chapter 3: Build Software for PS Subsystems](#chapter-3). For this
 example, the PetaLinux is configured to build images for SD-boot. This
 is the default boot setting in PetaLinux.

 The images can be found in the `$<PetaLinux_Project>/images/linux/` directory. For loading Linux on APU, the following images will be used from PetaLinux:

- ATF - `bl31.elf`

- U-Boot - `u-boot.elf`

-  Linux images - `image.ub`, which contains:

    - Kernel image

    - Device Tree `system.dtb`

    - File system `rootfs.cpio.gz.u-boot`

 In addition to Linux on APU, this example also loads a bare-metal
 Application on RPU Cortex- R5F in Lockstep mode.

 For this example, refer the testapp_r5 application that you created in
 [Create Custom
 Bare-Metal](#create-custom-bare-metal-application-for-arm-cortex-r5-based-rpu)
 [Application for Arm Cortex-R5 based
 RPU](#create-custom-bare-metal-application-for-arm-cortex-r5-based-rpu).

 Alternatively, you can also find the testapp_r5.elf executable in the
 design files that accompany this tutorial. See [Design Files for This
 Tutorial](#design-files-for-this-tutorial) for information about
 downloading the design files for this tutorial.

## Boot Sequence for SD-Boot

 Now that all the individual images are ready, create the boot image to
 load all of these components on Zynq UltraScale+. This can be done
 using the Create Boot Image wizard in the Vitis IDE, using the
 following steps:

1. In the Vitis IDE, select **Xilinx â†’ Create Boot Image**.

2. Select all the partitions referred in earlier sections in this
     chapter, and set them as shown in the following figure.

    ![](./media/image55.png)

3. First, add the FSBL partition.
 
   1. In the Create Boot Image wizard, click **Add** to open the Add partition view.
   2. In the Add Partition view, click **Browse** to select the FSBL executable.
   3. For FSBL, ensure that the partition type is selected as boot loader and the correct destination CPU is selected by the tool. The tool is configured to make this selection based on the FSBL executable.

    >    ***Note*:** Ignore the Exception Level drop down, as FSBL is set to
        EL3 by default. Also, leave the TrustZone setting unselected for this
        example.

    ![](./media/image56.png)

    4. Click **OK** to select FSBL and go back to Create Boot Image wizard.

4. Next, add the PMU and ATF firmware partitions.

    1. Click **Add** to open the Add Partition view, shown in the
         following figure.

        ![](./media/image57.png)

    2. Add the PMU firmware partition.

        1. Browse to and select the **PMU Firmware executable**.

        2. For this partition, select **pmu** as the partition type.

    3. Leave the Exception Level and TrustZone settings unselected.

    4. Click **OK**.

    5. Click **Add** to open Add Partition view.

    6. Add the ATF firmware `bl31.elf` partition.

        > ***Note*:** ATF Firmware (`bl31.elf`) can be found in `<PetaLinux
            Project>/image/linux/`. Alternatively, you can also use `bl31.elf` from
            [Design Files for This Tutorial](#design-files-for-this-tutorial).

        1. For this partition, select **datafile** as the partition type.
        2. Set the Destination Device as **PS**.
        3. Set the Destination CPU as **A53 0**.
        4. Set the Exception Level to EL3 and select **Enable TrustZone**.

        ![](./media/image58.png)

    7. Click **OK**.

3. Next, add the R5 executable and enable it in lockstep mode.

    1. Click **Add** to add the Cortex-R5F bare-metal executable.

        ![](./media/image59.png)

    2. Set the Destination Device as **PS**.

    3. Set the Destination CPU as **R5 Lockstep**. This sets the RPU R5 cores to run in Lockstep mode.

    4. Leave Exception Level and TrustZone unselected.

    5. Click **OK**.

4. Now, add the U-Boot partition. You can find `u-boot.elf` for sd_boot mode in `<PetaLinux_project>/images/linux/sd_boot`.

    1. Click **Add** to add the u-boot.elf partition.

    2. For U-Boot, select the Destination Device as **PS**.

    3. Select the Destination CPU as **A53 0**.

    4. Set the Exception Level to **EL2**.

        ![](./media/image60.png)

    5. Click **OK** to return to the Create Boot Image wizard.

    6. Click **Create Image** to close the wizard and create the boot
        image.

 You can also create `BOOT.bin` images using the BIF attributes and the
 Bootgen command. For this configuration, the BIF file contains
 following attributes:
 
 ```
 //arch = zynqmp; split = false; format = BIN
 the_ROM_image:
 {
 [bootloader, destination_cpu = a53-0]C:\edt\fsbl_a53\Debug\fsbl_a53.elf
 [pmufw_image]C:\edt\edt_zcu102_wrapper\export\edt_zcu102_wrapper\sw\edt_zcu102_wrapper\boot\pmufw.elf
 [destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-3, trustzone]C:\edt\sd_boot\bl31.elf
 [destination_cpu = r5-lockstep]C:\edt\testapp_r5\Debug\testapp_r5.elf
 [destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-2]C:\edt\sd_boot\u-boot.elf
 }
 ```

 The Vitis IDE calls the following Bootgen command to generate the
 BOOT.bin image for this configuration:

 ```
 bootgen -image sd_boot.bif -arch zynqmp -o C:\edt\sd_boot\BOOT.bin
 ```

### Running the Image on the ZCU102 Board

1. Copy the `BOOT.bin`, `image.ub`, and `boot.scr` to the SD card. Here
     `boot.scr` is read by U-Boot to load kernel and the root file
     system.

2. Load the SD card into the ZCU102 board, in the J100 connector.

3. Connect a micro USB cable from ZCU102 board USB UART port (J83) to
     the USB port on the host machine.

4. Configure the board to boot in the
     SD-boot mode by setting switch SW6 to 1-ON, 2-OFF, 3- OFF, and
     4-OFF, as shown in following figure.
     
    ![](./media/image43.jpeg)

5. Connect 12V Power to the ZCU102 6-Pin Molex connector.

6. Start a terminal session, using Tera Term or Minicom depending on
     the host machine being used, as well as the COM port and baud rate
     for your system, as shown in following figure.

    ![](./media/image44.png)

7. For port settings, verify COM port in device manager. There are four
     USB-UART interfaces exposed by the ZCU102 board.

8. Select the COM port associated with the interface with the lowest
     number. In this case, for UART-0, select the COM port with
     interface-0.

9. Similarly, for UART-1, select COM port with interface-1. Remember
     that the R5 BSP has been configured to use UART-1, and so R5
     application messages appear on the COM port with the UART-1
     terminal.

10. Turn on the ZCU102 Board using SW1, and wait until Linux loads on
     the board. At this point, you can see the initial boot sequence
     messages on your terminal screen representing UART-0.

    You can see that the terminal screen configured for UART-1 also prints
    a message. This is the print message from the R5 bare-metal
    application running on RPU, configured to use UART-1 interface. This
    application is loaded by the FSBL onto RPU.

    The bare-metal application has been modified to include the UART
    interrupt example. This application now waits in the waiting for
    interrupt (WFI) state until a user input is encountered from the
    keyboard in UART-1 terminal.

    ![](./media/image61.png)

    Meanwhile, the boot sequence continues on APU and the images loaded
    can be understood from the messages appearing on the UART-0 terminal.
    The messages are highlighted in the following figure.

    The U-Boot then loads Linux kernel and other images on Arm Cortex-A53
    APU in SMP mode. The terminal messages indicate when the U-Boot loads
    the kernel image and the kernel start up to getting a user interface
    prompt in Target Linux OS. The kernel loading and starting sequence
    can be seen in the following figure.

    ![](./media/image63.png)

## Boot Sequence for QSPI Boot Mode

 The ZCU102 board also comes with dual parallel QSPI flashes adding up
 to 128 MB size. In this example, you will create a boot image and load
 the images on Zynq UltraScale+ in QSPI boot mode. The images can be
 configured using the Create Boot Image wizard in the Vitis IDE. This
 can be done by doing the following steps.

 >***Note*:** This section assumes that you have created PetaLinux
 Images for QSPI Boot mode by following steps from [Create Linux Images
 Using PetaLinux for QSPI
 Flash](#create-linux-images-using-petalinux-for-qspi-flash).

1. If the Vitis IDE is not already running, start it and set the
     workspace as indicated in [Chapter 3: Build Software for PS
     Subsystems](#chapter-3).

2. Select **Xilinx â†’ Create Boot Image**.

3. Select **Zynq MP** as the Architecture.

4. Select the **Create new BIF** file option.

5. Ensure that the Output format is set to BIN.

6. In the Basic page, browse to and
     select the **Output BIF** file path and output path.

     ![](./media/image64.png)

7. Next, add boot partitions using the following steps:

    1. Click **Add** to open the Add Partition view.

    2. In the Add Partition view, click the **Browse** button to select
         the **FSBL executable**.

        1. For FSBL, ensure that the
             Partition type is selected as boot loader and the correct
             destination CPU is selected by the tool. The tool is
             configured to make this selection based on the FSBL
             executable.

             ![](./media/image65.jpeg)

        2. Ignore the Exception Level, as FSBL is set to EL3 by
             default. Also, leave the TrustZone setting unselected for
             this example.

        3. Click **OK** to select the FSBL and go back to the Create
              Boot Image wizard.

    3. Click **Add** to open the Add Partition window to add the next
         partition.

    4. The next partition is the PMU firmware for the Platform
         Management Unit.

        1.  Select the Partition type as **datafile** and the
             Destination Device as **PS**.

        2. Select **PMU** for Destination CPU.

        3. Click **OK**.

            ![](./media/image66.png)

    5. The next partition to be added is the ATF firmware. For this, set
     the Partition type to datafile.

       1.  The ATF executable `bl31.elf` can be found in the PetaLinux images
            folder, `<PetaLinux_project\/images/linux/`.

       2. Select the Destination Device as **PS** and the Destination CPU as
           A53 0.

       3. Set the Exception Level to EL3 and
           select Enable TrustZone.

           ![](./media/image67.png)

       4. Click **OK**.

    6. Click **Add** to add the R5 bare-metal executable.

        1. Add the R5 executable and enable it in lockstep mode, as shown
            in the following image.

        2. Click **OK**.

            ![](./media/image68.jpeg)

    7. Click **Add** to add the U-Boot partition. u-boot.elf can be found in `<PetaLinux_Project>/images/linux/`.

        1. For U-Boot, make the following selections:

            - Set the Partition Type to **datafile**.

            - Set the Destination Device to **PS**.

            - Set the Destination CPU to **A53 0**.

            - Set the Exception Level to **EL2**.

            ![](./media/image69.png)

        2. Click **OK**.

    8. Click **Add** to add the image.ub Linux image file.

        1.  The image.ub image file can be found in PetaLinux project in the
            `images/Linux` directory.

        2. For image.ub, make the following selections:

           - Set Partition Type to **datafile**.

           - Set the Destination Device to **PS**.

           - Set the Destination CPU to **A53 0**.

        3. Enter `0xF00000` as the offset.

        4. Leave Exception Level and TrustZone unselected.

        ***Note*:** See [Create Linux Images Using PetaLinux for QSPI
        Flash](#create-linux-images-using-petalinux-for-qspi-flash), to
        understand the offset value.

   9. Click **Add** to add the `boot.scr` script file.

        1. The `boot.scr` file is located in the images/linux directory of
            the PetaLinux project.

        2. For `boot.scr`, select the following:

            - Set partition type to **datafile**.

            - Set the Destination Device to **PS**.

            - Set the Destination CPU to **A53 0**.

        3. Enter 0x3e80000 as the offset.

        4. Leave Exception Level and TrustZone unselected.

        ![](./media/image70.png)

8. Click **OK** to go back to Create Boot Image wizard.

9. Click **Create Image** to create the `qspi_BOOT.bin` image.

 You can also create qspi_BOOT.bin images using the BIF attributes and
 the Bootgen command. You can view the BIF attributes for this
 configuration by clicking **Preview BIF Changes**. For this
 configuration, the BIF file contains following attributes:

 ```
 //arch = zynqmp; split = false; format = BIN
 the_ROM_image:
 {
 [bootloader, destination_cpu = a53-0]C:\edt\fsbl_a53\Debug\fsbl_a53.elf
 [destination_cpu = pmu]C:\edt\edt_zcu102_wrapper\export\edt_zcu102_wrapper\sw\edt_zcu102_wrapper\boot\pmufw.elf
 [destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-3, trustzone]C:\edt\qspi_boot\bl31.elf
 [destination_cpu = r5-lockstep]C:\edt\testapp_r5\Debug\testapp_r5.elf
 [destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-2]C:\edt\qspi_boot\u-boot.elf
 [offset = 0xF00000, destination_cpu = a53-0]C:\edt\qspi_boot\image.ub
 [offset = 0x3e80000, destination_cpu = a53-0]C:\edt\qspi_boot\boot.scr
 }
 ```

 The Vitis IDE calls the following Bootgen command to generate the
 qspi_BOOT.bin image for this configuration.

 ```
 bootgen -image qspi_boot.bif -arch zynqmp -o C:\edt\qspi_BOOT.bin
 ```

 >***Note*:** In this boot sequence, the First Stage Boot Loader (FSBL)
 loads PMU firmware. This is because the PMU firmware was added as a
 datafile partition type. Ideally, the Boot ROM code can load the PMU
 Firmware for PMU as witnessed in the earlier section. For more details
 on PMU Firmware, refer to the "Platform Management" chapter in the
 *Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC: Software Developers Guide*
 ([UG1137](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/rdoc?v=latest%3Bd%3Dug1137-zynq-ultrascale-mpsoc-swdev.pdf)).

### Running the Image in QSPI Boot Mode on ZCU102 Board

 To test the image in this example, you will load the Boot image
 (qspi_BOOT.bin) onto QSPI on the ZCU102 board using the Program Flash
 utility in the Vitis IDE. Alternately, you can use the XSDB debugger.

1. In the Vitis IDE, select **Xilinx â†’ Program Flash**.

2. In the Program Flash wizard, browse to and select the `qspi_BOOT.bin`
     image file that was created as a part of this example.

3. Select **qspi-x8-dual_parallel** as the Flash type.

4. Set the Offset as **0** and select the **FSBL ELF file (fsbl_a53.elf)**

5. Ensure that a USB cable is connected between the USB-JTAG connector on ZCU102 target and the USB port on the host machine using the following steps.

    1. Set the SW6 Boot mode switch as shown in the following figure.

    2. Turn on the board.

     ![](./media/image26.jpeg)

6. Click **Program** to start the process of programming the QSPI Flash
     with the qspi_BOOT.bin

    ![](./media/image71.jpeg)

    Wait until you see the message "Flash Operation Successful" in the
    console, as shown in the following image.

    ![](./media/image72.png)

#### Set Up the ZCU102 Board

1. Connect Board USB-UART on Board to Host machine. Connect the Micro
     USB cable into the ZCU102 Board Micro USB port J83, and the other
     end into an open USB port on the host machine.

2. Configure the Board to Boot in QSPI-Boot mode by switching SW6 as
     shown in following figure.

    ![](./media/image73.jpeg)

3. Connect 12V Power to the ZCU102 6-Pin Molex connector.

4. Start a terminal session, using Tera Term or Mini com, depending on
     the host machine being used, and the COM port and baud rate as
     shown in the following figure.

5. For port settings, verify the COM port in the device manager. There
     are four USB UART interfaces exposed by the ZCU102.

6. Select the COM port associated with the interface with the lowest
     number. In this case, for UART-0, select the COM port with
     interface-0.

7. Similarly, for UART-1, select COM port with interface-1.

    Remember, R5 BSP has been configured to use UART-1, so R5 application
    messages will appear on the COM port with UART-1 terminal.

    ![](./media/image44.png)

8. Turn on the ZCU102 Board using SW1.

    At this point, you can see initial Boot sequence messages on your
    Terminal Screen representing UART-0.

    You can see that the terminal screen configured for UART-1 also prints
    a message. This is the print message from the R-5 bare-metal
    Application running on RPU, configured to use

    UART-1 interface. This application is loaded by the FSBL onto RPU.

    The bare-metal application has been modified to include the UART
    interrupt example. This application now waits in the WFI state until a
    user input is encountered from the keyboard in UART-1 terminal.

    ![](./media/image61.png)

    Meanwhile, the boot sequence continues on APU and the images loaded
    can be understood from the messages appearing on the UART-0 terminal.
    The messages are highlighted in the following figure.

    ![](./media/image74.png)

    The U-Boot then loads Linux Kernel and other images on Arm Cortex-A53
    APU in SMP mode. The terminal messages indicate when U-Boot loads
    Kernel image and the kernel start up to getting a user interface
    prompt in Linux Kernel. The Kernel loading and starting sequence can
    be seen in following figure.

    ![](./media/image63.png)

## Boot Sequence for QSPI-Boot Mode Using JTAG

 Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC supports many methods to load the boot image.
 One way is using the JTAG interface. This example XSCT session
 demonstrates how to download a boot image file (`qspi_BOOT.bin`) in QSPI
 using the XSDB debugger. After the QSPI is loaded, the `qspi_BOOT.bin`
 image executes in the same way as QSPI boot mode in Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC. You can use the same XSCT session or the System Debugger for debugging similar boot flows.

 The following sections demonstrate the basic steps involved in this
 boot mode.

### Setting Up the Target

1. Connect a USB cable between the USB-JTAG J2 connector on the target
     and the USB port on the host machine.

2. Set the board to JTAG Boot mode by setting the SW6 switch, as shown in the following figure.
     
	 ![](./media/image26.jpeg)

3. Power on the board using switch SW1. Open the XSCT console in the
     Vitis IDE by clicking the XSCT button. Alternatively, you can also
     open the XSCT console by selecting **Xilinx â†’ XSCT Console**.

4. In the XSCT console, connect to the target over JTAG using the
     connect command:

    ```
	xsct% connect
	```

    The connect command returns the channel ID of the connection.

5. The targets command lists the available targets and allows you to
     select a target using its ID. The targets are assigned IDs as they
     are discovered on the JTAG chain, so the IDs can change from
     session to session.

    >***Note*:** For non-interactive usage such as scripting, you can use
    the -filter option to select a target instead of selecting the target
    using its ID.

    ```
	xsct% targets
	```

    The targets are listed as shown in the following figure.

    ![](./media/image75.png)

### Load U-Boot Using XSCT/XSDB

1. Download the U-Boot application on Cortex-A53 \#0 using the
     following commands:

    By default, JTAG Security gates are enabled. Disable the security
    gates for DAP, PL TAP, and PMU (this will make PMU MB target visible
    to Debugger).

    ```
    xsct% targets -set -filter {name =~ "PSU"}
    xsct% mwr 0xffca0038 0x1ff
    xsct% targets
    ```

    Verify if the PMU MB target is listed under the PMU device. Now, load
    and run PMU Firmware.

    Now, reset APU Cortex-A53 Core 0 to load and run FSBL.

    ```
    xsct% targets -set -filter {name =~ "Cortex-A53 #0"}
    xsct% rst -processor
    ```

    >***Note*:** `rst -processor` clears the reset on an individual processor
    core.

    This step is important, because when Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC boots up
    in JTAG boot mode, all the APU and RPU cores are held in reset. You
    must clear resets on each core before performing debugging on these
    cores. You can use therst command in XSCT to clear the resets.

    >***Note*:** `rst -cores` clears resets on all the processor cores in the
    group (such as APU or RPU) of which the current target is a child. For
    example, when A53 #0 is the current target, `rst -cores` clears resets
    on all the Cortex-A53 cores in APU.

    Load and run FSBL.

    ```
    xsct% dow {C:\edt\fsbl_a53\Debug\fsbl_a53.elf}
    xsct% con
    ```

    Verify FSBL messages on Serial Terminal and stop FSBL after couple of
    seconds.

    ```
	xsct% stop
	```

    Load and run ATF.

    ```
    xsct% dow {C:\edt\qspi_boot\bl31.elf}
    xsct% con
    xsct% stop
    ```

2. Configure a serial terminal (Tera Term, Mini com, or the Serial
     Terminal interface for UART-0 USB-serial connection).

3. For serial terminal settings, see the following figure.
     
	 ![](./media/image76.png)

4. Load and run U-Boot.

    ```
	xsct% dow {C:\edt\qspi_boot\u-boot.elf}
	```

5. Run U-Boot, using the con command in XSDB.

    ```
	xsct% con
	```

6. In the target serial terminal, press any key to stop the U-Boot auto boot.

7. Stop the core using the stop command in XSDB.

    ```
	xsct% stop
	```

### Load Boot.bin in DDR Using XSDB

1. Download the Boot.bin binary into DDR on ZCU102. Use the same
     Boot.bin created for QSPI boot mode.

    ```
	xsct% dow -data {C:\edt\qspi_boot\qspi_BOOT.bin} 0x2000000
	```

2. Now continue the U-Boot again, using the con command in XSDB.

    ```
	xsct% con
	```

### Load the Boot.bin Image in QSPI Using U-Boot

1. Execute the following commands in the U-Boot console on the target
     terminal. These commands erase QSPI and then write the Boot.bin
     image from DDR to QSPI.

    ```
    ZynqMP> sf probe 0 0 0
    ZynqMP> sf erase 0 0x4000000
    ZynqMP> sf write 0x2000000 0 0x4000000
    ```

2. After successfully writing the image to QSPI, turn off the board and
     set up the ZCU102 board as described in [Set Up the ZCU102
     Board](#set-up-the-zcu102-board).

    You can see Linux loading on the UART-0 terminal and the R5
    application executing in the UART-1 terminal.

    This chapter focused mostly on system boot and different components
    related to system boot. In the next chapter, you will focus on
    applications, Linux, and Standalone (bare-metal) applications which
    will make use of PS peripherals, PL IPs, and processing power of APU
    Cores and RPU cores.

## Boot Sequence for USB Boot Mode

 Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC also supports USB Slave Boot Mode. This is
 using the USB DFU Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) Device Class
 Specification of USB. Using a standard update utility such as
 [OpenMoko\'s DFU-Util](http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net/releases/), you
 will be able to load the newly created image on

 Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC using the USB Port. The following steps list
 the required configuration to load boot images using this boot mode.
 The DFU Utility is also shipped with the Vitis unified software
 platform and PetaLinux.

### Configure FSBL to Enable USB Boot Mode

 There are few changes required in FSBL to enable USB Boot Mode. USB
 boot mode support increases the footprint of FSBL (by approximately 10
 KB). Because it is intended mostly during the initial development
 phase, its support is disabled by default to conserve OCM space. In
 this section, you will modify the FSBL to enable the USB Boot Mode.
 Considering the FSBL project is used extensively throughout this
 tutorial, do not modify the existing FSBL project. Instead, this
 section will make use of new FSBL project.

#### Create First Stage Boot Loader for USB Boot

1. In the Vitis IDE, select **Fileâ†’ New â†’ Application Project** to open
     the New Project wizard.

2. Use the information in the table below to make your selections in
     the wizard.

    *Table 9:*  **Wizard Properties and Commands** 

   |  Wizard Screen       |    System Properties   |  Settings       |
   |----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
   |  Platform            |  Select platform from repository      |  edt_zcu102_wrapper |
   |  Application project details        |  Application project name       |  fsbl_usb_boot      |
   |                      |  System project name    |  fsbl_usb_boot_system                    |
   |                      |  Target processor   |  psu_cortexa53_0    |
   |  Domain             |  Domain             |  standalone on psu_cortexa53_0     |
   |  Templates          |  Available templates         |  Zynq MP FSBL       |

3. Click **Finish**.

4. In the Explorer view, expand the fsbl_usb_boot project and open
     `xfsbl_config.h` from **fsbl_usb_bootâ†’ srcâ†’xfsbl_config.h**.

5. In `xfsbl_config.h` change or set following settings:

    ```
    #define FSBL_QSPI_EXCLUDE_VAL (1U)
    #define FSBL_SD_EXCLUDE_VAL (1U)
    #define FSBL_USB_EXCLUDE_VAL (0U)
    ```

6. Use **CTRL + S** to save these changes.

7. Build FSBL (fsbl_usb_boot).

### Creating Boot Images for USB Boot

 In this section, you will create the Boot Images to be loaded, via USB
 using DFU utility. Device firmware upgrade (DFU) is intended to
 download and upload firmware to/from devices connected over USB. In
 this boot mode, the boot loader (FSBL) and the PMU firmware which are
 loaded by bootROM are copied to Zynq UltraScale+ on-chip memory (OCM)
 from the host machine USB port using DFU Utility. The size of OCM (256
 KB) limits the size of boot image downloaded by bootROM in USB boot
 mode. Considering this, and subject to size requirement being met,
 only FSBL and PMU firmware are stitched into the first boot.bin, which
 is copied to OCM. The remaining boot partitions will be stitched in
 another boot image and copied to DDR to be loaded by the FSBL which is
 already loaded and running at this stage. Follow these steps to create
 boot images for this boot mode.

1. In the Vitis IDE, select **Xilinx â†’ Create Boot Image**.

2. Select `fsbl_usb_boot.elf` and
     `pmufw.elf` partitions and set them as shown in the following
     figure.
     
     ![](./media/image77.png)

3. Ensure that PMU partition is set to be loaded by bootROM.

4. Click **Create Image** to generate BOOT.bin.

#### Modifying PetaLinux U-Boot

 Modify PetaLinux U-Boot so that it can load the image.ub image. The
 device tree needs to be modified to set USB in the Peripheral mode.
 The default PetaLinux configuration is set for the USB in host mode.
 Follow these steps to modify `system-user.dtsi` in the PetaLinux project

 `<PetaLinux-project>/project-spec/meta-user/recipes-bsp/device-tree/
 files/system-user.dtsi`.

1. Add the following to system-user.dtsi, so that it looks like:

    ```
    /include/ "system-conf.dtsi"
    / {
    gpio-keys { sw19 {
    status = "disabled";
    };
    };
    };
    &uart1
    {
    status = "disabled";
    };
    &dwc3_0 {
    dr_mode = "peripheral"; maximum-speed = "super-speed";
    };
    ```

    The modified system-user.dtsi file can be found in `<Design Files>/usb_boot` released with the tutorial.

2. Build PetaLinux with the following changes.

    ```
	$ petalinux-build
	```

The following steps describe how to create a `usb_boot.bin` comprising rest of the partitions.

>***Note*:** Copy the newly generated U-Boot to `C:\edt\usb_boot\`. The `u-boot.elf` is also available in [Design Files for This Tutorial](#design-files-for-this-tutorial).

1. In the Vitis IDE, select **Xilinx â†’ Create Boot Image**.

2. Select **FSBL** and rest of the partitions and set them as shown in
     the following figure. You can also choose to import the BIF file
     from the SD boot sequence.

     ![](./media/image78.png)

    >***Note*:** Ensure that you have set the correct exception levels for
    ATF (EL-3, TrustZone) and U-Boot (EL-2) partitions. These settings can
    be ignored for other partitions.

     The PMU firmware partition is not required in this image, as
     it will be loaded by the bootROM before this image (`usb_boot.bin`)
     is loaded.

3. Click on **Create Image** to generate `usb_boot.bin`.

    >***Note*:** In addition to `BOOT.bin` and `usb_boot.bin`, the Linux image
    like image.ub is required to boot till Linux. This `image.ub` is loaded by the DFU utility separately.

### Boot using USB Boot

 In this section you will load the boot images on ZCU102 target using
 DFU utility. Before you start, set the board connections as shown
 below:

1. Set ZCU102 for USB Boot mode by
    setting SW6 (1-OFF, 2-OFF, 3-OFF, and 4-ON), as shown below:
     
    ![](./media/image79.jpeg)

2. Connect a USB 3.0 Cable to J96 USB 3 ULPI Connector, and the other
     end of the Cable to USB port on the host machine.

3. Connect a USB Micro cable between USB-UART port on Board (J83) and
     the host machine.

4. Start a terminal session, using Tera Term or Minicom depending on
     the host machine being used, as well as the COM port and baud rate
     for your system, as shown in Figure 5-31.

5. Power ON the board.

 The following steps will load the boot images via USB using DFU
 utility, which can be found in `VITIS\2019.1\tps\lnx64\dfu-util-0.9`.

 Alternatively you can also install DFU utility on the Linux using
 Package Manager supported by Linux Distribution.

#### Boot Commands for Linux Host Machine

1. Check if the DFU can detect the USB target.

    ```
	$ sudo dfu-util -l
	```

    The USB device should be enumerated with VendorId: ProductId which is
    `03fd:0050`. You should see something like the following message: `Found DFU: [03fd:0050] ver=0100, devnum=30, cfg=1, intf=0, alt=0, name="Xilinx DFU Downloader", serial="2A49876D9CC1AA4"`

    >***Note*:** If you do not see the 'Found DFU' message, verify the
    connection and retry.

2. Now download the BOOT.bin that was created in [Creating Boot Images
     for USB Boot](#creating-boot-images-for-usb-boot).

    ```
	$ sudo dfu-util -d 03fd:0050 -D <USB_Boot_Image_Path>/Boot.bin
	```

    Verify from Serial Terminal if the FSBL is loaded successfully.

3. Now download the usb_boot.bin. Before this, start another terminal
     session for UART-1 serial console.

    ```
	$ sudo dfu-util -d 03fd:0050 -D <USB_Boot_Image_Path>/usb_boot.bin
	```

    Check UART 0 terminal and wait until U-Boot loads.

4. On U-Boot prompt, type **Enter** to terminate autoboot. Verify from
     the UART1 console that the R5 application is also loaded
     successfully.

5. Run the following commands to setup the dfu environment in the
     U-Boot command line:

    ```
    $ setenv loadaddr 0x10000000
    $ setenv kernel_addr 0x10000000
    $ setenv kernel_size 0x1e00000
    $ setenv dfu_ram_info "setenv dfu_alt_info image.ub ram $kernel_addr
    $kernel_size"
    ```

6. In U-Boot console start DFU_RAM to enable downloading Linux Images

    ```
	U-boot\ run dfu_ram
	```

7. Download the Linux image Image.ub using the following command from
     the host machine terminal:

    ```
	$ sudo dfu-util -d 03fd:0300 -D <PetaLinux_project>/images/linux/image.ub -a 0
	```

8. Now execute **CTRL+C** on U-Boot console to stop dfu_ram.

9. Run bootm command from the U-Boot console.

    ```
	U-boot\ bootm
	```

10. Verify that Linux loads successfully on the target.

 >***Note*:** In this example, image.ub is copied to DDR location based
 on \#define DFU_ALT_INFO_RAM settings in U-Boot configuration. The
 same can be modified to copy other image files to DDR location. Then,
 if required, these images can be copied to QSPI using U-Boot commands
 listed in [Boot Sequence
 for](#boot-sequence-for-qspi-boot-mode-using-jtag) [QSPI-Boot Mode
 Using JTAG](#boot-sequence-for-qspi-boot-mode-using-jtag).

#### Boot Commands for Windows Host Machine

1. In the Vitis IDE, Select **Xilinx â†’ Launch Shell**.

2. In shell, check if the DFU can detect the USB target:

    ```
	> dfu-util.exe -l
	```

    >***Note*:** `dfu-util.exe` can be found in `<VITIS_Installation_path>\VITIS\2020.1\tps\Win64\dfu-util-0.9\dfu-util.exe`

3. The USB device should be enumerated with VendorId: ProductId which
     is `03fd:0050`.

    >***Note*:** If you do not see the message starting with "Found DFU",
    download and install "zadig" software. Open the software and click
    **Options** and select **List all devices**. Select device **Xilinx
    Dfu Downloader** and click **Install driver**.

4. Now download the Boot.bin that was created in [Creating Boot Images
     for USB Boot](#creating-boot-images-for-usb-boot).

    ```
	$ dfu-util.exe -d 03fd:0050 -D BOOT.bin
	```

5. Verify from Serial Terminal (UART 0) that FSBL is loaded
     successfully.

6. Now download the usb_boot.bin. Before this start another terminal
     session for UART-1 serial console.

    ```
	$ dfu-util.exe -d 03fd:0050 -D usb_boot.bin
	```

7. On U-Boot prompt type Enter to terminate auto-boot. Verify from
     UART1 console that the R5 application is also loaded successfully.

    >***Note*:** At this point, use Zadig utility to install drivers for
    "USB download gadget" with device ID 03fd:0300. Without this, zadig
    software does not show "Xilinx DFU Downloader" after booting U-Boot
    on target.

8. Run the following commands to setup the dfu environment in U-Boot
     command line:

    ```
    $ setenv loadaddr 0x10000000
    $ setenv kernel_addr 0x10000000
    $ setenv kernel_size 0x1e00000
    $ setenv dfu_ram_info "setenv dfu_alt_info image.ub ram $kernel_addr $kernel_size"
    ```

9. In U-Boot console, start DFU_RAM to enable downloading Linux Images:

    ```
	U-boot\ run dfu_ram
	```

10. Download Linux image image.ub using the following command from the
     host machine terminal:

    ```
	$ dfu-util.exe -d 03fd:0300 -D image.ub -a 0
	```

11. Run bootm command from the U-Boot console.

    ```
	U-boot\ bootm
	```

12. Verify that Linux loads successfully on the target.

## Secure Boot Sequence

 The secure boot functionality in Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC allows you to
 support confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of partitions.
 Secure boot is accomplished by combining the Hardware Root of Trust
 (HROT) capabilities of the Zynq UltraScale+ device with the option of
 encrypting all boot partitions. The HROT is based on the RSA-4096
 asymmetric algorithm with SHA-3/384, which is hardware accelerated.
 Confidentiality is provided using 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard Galois Counter Mode (AES-GCM). This section focuses on how to use
 and implement the following:

- Hardware Root of Trust with Key Revocation

- Partition Encryption with Differential Power Analysis (DPA)
     Countermeasures

- Black Key Storage using the Physically Unclonable Function (PUF)

 The section [Secure Boot System Design
 Decisions](#secure-boot-system-design-decisions) outlines high level
 secure boot decisions which should be made early in design
 development. The [Hardware Root of Trust](#hardware-root-of-trust)
 section discusses the use of a Root of Trust (RoT) in boot. The [Boot
 Image Confidentiality and DPA](#boot-image-confidentiality-and-dpa)
 section discusses methods to use AES encryption.

 The [Boot Image Confidentiality and
 DPA](#boot-image-confidentiality-and-dpa) section discusses the use of
 the operational key and key rolling techniques as countermeasures to a
 DPA attack. Changing the AES key reduces the exposure of both the key
 and the data protected by the key.

 A red key is a key in unencrypted format. The [Black Key
 Storage](#black-key-storage) section provides a method for storing the
 AES key in encrypted, or black format. Black key store uses the
 physically unclonable function (PUF) as a Key Encryption Key (KEK).

 The [Practical Methods in Secure
 Boot](#practical-methods-in-secure-boot) section provides steps to
 develop and test systems that use AES encryption and RSA
 authentication.

### Secure Boot System Design Decisions

The following are device level decisions affecting secure boot:

- Boot mode

- AES key storage location

- AES storage state (encrypted or unencrypted)

- Encryption and authentication requirements

- Key provisioning

 The boot modes which support secure boot are Quad Serial Peripheral
 Interface (QSPI), SD, eMMC, USB Boot, and NAND. The AES key is stored
 in either eFUSEs (encrypted or unencrypted), Battery Backed Random
 Access Memory (BBRAM) (unencrypted only), or in external NVM
 (encrypted only).

 In Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC, partitions can be encrypted and/or
 authenticated on a partition basis. Xilinx generally recommends that
 all partitions be RSA authenticated. Partitions that are open source
 (U-Boot, Linux), or do not contain any proprietary or confidential
 information, typically do not need to be encrypted. In systems in
 which there are multiple sources/suppliers of sensitive data and/or
 proprietary IP, encrypting the partitions using unique keys may be
 important.

 DPA resistance requirements are dictated by whether the adversary has
 physical access to the device.

 The following table can be a good reference while deciding on features
 required to meet a specific secure system requirement. Next sections
 will discuss the features in more detail.

*Table 10:* **System Level Security Requirements**

| System Consideration/          | Zynq UltraScale+ Feature  |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
|  Ensure that only the users software and hardware runs on the device      | HWROT                          |
|  Guarantee that the users software and hardware are not modified        | HWROT                          |
|  Ensure that an adversary cannot clone or reverse engineer software/hardware  | Boot Image Confidentiality     |
|  Protect sensitive data and proprietary Intellectual Property (IP)       | Boot Image Confidentiality     |
|  Ensure that Private Key (AES key) is protected against side channel attacks    | DPA Protections                |
|  Private/Secret keys (AES key) is stored encrypted at rest | Black Key Storage              |

#### Hardware Root of Trust

 Root of trusts are security primitives for storage (RTS), integrity
 (RTI), verification (RTV), measurement (RTM), and reporting (RTR). RoT
 consists of hardware, firmware, and software. The HROT has advantages
 over software RoTs because the HROT is immutable, has a smaller attack
 surface, and the behavior is more reliable.

 The HROT is based on the CSU, eFUSEs, BBRAM, and isolation elements.
 The HROT is responsible for validating that the operating environment
 and configuration have not been modified. The RoT acts as an anchor
 for boot, so an adversary can not insert malicious code before
 detection mechanisms start.

 Firmware and software run on the HROT during boot. Zynq UltraScale+
 provides immutable bootROM code, a first stage boot loader, device
 drivers, and the XILSKEY and XILSECURE libraries which run on the
 HROT. These provide a well-tested, proven in use API so that
 developers do not create security components from scratch with limited
 testing.

##### Data Integrity

 Data integrity is the absence of corruption of hardware, firmware and
 software. Data integrity functions verify that an adversary has not
 tampered with the configuration and operating environment.

 Zynq UltraScale+ verifies the integrity of partition(s) using both
 symmetric key (AES-GCM) and asymmetric key (RSA) authentication. RSA
 uses a private/public key pair. The fielded embedded system only has
 the public key. Theft of the public key is of limited value since it
 is not possible, with current technology, to derive the private key
 from the public key.

 Encrypted partitions are also authenticated using the Galois Counter
 Mode (GCM) mode of AES. In the secure boot flow, partitions are first
 authenticated and then decrypted if necessary.

##### Authentication

 The following figure shows RSA signing and verification of partitions.
 From a secure facility, the Bootgen tool signs partitions, using the
 private key. In the device, the ROM verifies the FSBL and either the
 FSBL or U-Boot verifies the subsequent partitions, using the public
 key.

 Primary and secondary private/public key pairs are used. The function
 of the primary private/ public key pair is to authenticate the
 secondary private/public key pair. The function of the secondary key
 is to sign/verify partitions.

 *Figure 4:* **Zynq UltraScale+ RSA Authentication**

![Zynq UltraScale+ RSA Authentication](./media/zynqus-rsa-auth.png)

 To sign a partition, Bootgen first calculates the SHA3 of the
 partition data. The 384-bit hash is then RSA signed using the private
 key. The resulting RSA signature is placed in the authentication
 certificate. In the image, each signed partition has partition data
 followed by an authentication certificate which includes the RSA
 signature.

 Verification of the FSBL is handled by the CSU ROM code. To verify the
 subsequent partitions, the FSBL or U-Boot uses the XILSECURE library.

 There is a debug mode for authentication called bootheader
 authentication. In this mode of authentication, the CSU ROM code does
 not check the primary public key digests, the session key ID or the
 key revocation bits stored in the device eFUSEs. Therefore, this mode
 is not secure. However, it is useful for testing and debugging as it
 does not require programming of eFUSEs.

 This tutorial uses this mode. However, fielded systems should not use
 boot header authentication. The example BIF file for a fully secured
 system is included at the end of this section.

#### Boot Image Confidentiality and DPA

 AES is used to ensure confidentiality of sensitive data and IP. Zynq
 UltraScale+ uses AES Galois Counter Mode (GCM). Zynq UltraScale+ uses
 a 256 AES bit key. The principle AES enhancements provided by Zynq
 UltraScale+ are increased resistance to Differential Power Analysis
 (DPA) attacks and the availability of AES encryption/decryption post
 boot.

 Bootgen and FSBL software support AES encryption. Private keys are
 used in AES encryption, and AES encryption is done by Bootgen using
 the key files. The key files can be generated by Bootgen or OpenSSL.
 The use of the operational key limits the exposure of the device key.
 The use of the operational key in key rolling is discussed in the next
 section. To maintain Boot image confidentiality, Encrypted Boot images
 can be created using Bootgen. Software examples to program keys to
 BBRAM and eFUSE are also available in the Vitis IDE. One such example
 is discussed in [Practical Methods in Secure
 Boot](#practical-methods-in-secure-boot).

#### DPA Protections

 Key rolling is used for DPA resistance. Key rolling and black key
 store can be used in the same design. In key rolling, software and
 bitstream is broken up into multiple data blocks, each encrypted with
 a unique AES key. The initial key is stored in BBRAM or eFUSE NVM.
 Keys for successive data blocks are encrypted in the previous data
 block. After the initial key, the key update register is used as the
 key source.

 A 96-bit initialization vector is included in the NKY key file. The IV
 uses 96 bits to initialize AES counters. When key rolling is used, a
 128-bit IV is provided in the bootheader. The 32 least significant
 bits define the block size of data to decrypt using the current key.
 The block sizes following the initial block defined in the IV are
 defined as attributes in the Bootgen Image Format (BIF) file.

 An efficient method of key rolling uses the operational key. With the
 operational key, Bootgen creates an encrypted secure header with the
 user specified operational key and the first block IV. The AES key in
 eFUSE or BBRAM is used only to decrypt the 384-bit secure header with
 the 256-bit operational key. This limits the exposure of the device
 key to DPA attacks.

#### Black Key Storage

 The PUF enables storing the AES key in encrypted (black) format. The
 black key can be stored either in eFUSEs or in the bootheader. When
 needed for decryption, the encrypted key in eFUSEs or the bootheader
 is decrypted using the PUF generated key encrypting key (KEK).

 There are two steps in using the PUF for black key storage. In the
 first, PUF registration software is used to generate PUF helper data
 and the PUF KEK. The PUF registration data allows the PUF to
 re-generate the identical key each time the PUF generates the KEK. For
 more details on the use of PUF registration software, see [PUF Registration in Bootheader Mode](#puf-registration-in-bootheader-mode). For more information on
 PUF Registration - eFUSE mode, see *Programming BBRAM and eFUSEs*
 ([XAPP1319](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/ndoc?t=application_notes%3Bd%3Dxapp1319-zynq-usp-prog-nvm.pdf)).

 The helper data and encrypted user key must both be stored in eFUSEs
 if the PUF eFUSE mode is used, and in the bootheader if the PUF
 Bootheader mode is used. The procedure for the PUF bootheader mode is
 discussed in [Using PUF in Bootheader Mode](#using-puf-in-bootheader-mode). For the procedure to use PUF in
 eFUSE mode, see *Programming BBRAM and eFUSEs*
 ([XAPP1319](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/ndoc?t=application_notes%3Bd%3Dxapp1319-zynq-usp-prog-nvm.pdf)).

 This tutorial uses PUF bootheader mode as it does not require
 programming of eFUSEs, and is therefore useful for test and debug.
 However, the most common mode is PUF eFUSE mode, as the PUB Bootheader
 mode requires a unique run of bootgen for each and every device. The
 example BIF file for a fully secured system is included at the end of
 the [Secure Boot Sequence](#secure-boot-sequence) section demonstrates
 the PUF eFUSE mode.

### Practical Methods in Secure Boot

 This section outlines the steps to develop secure boot in a Zynq
 UltraScale+ system. Producing a secure embedded system is a two-step
 process. In the first phase, the cryptographic keys are generated and
 programmed into NVM. In the second phase, the secure system is
 developed and tested. Both steps use the Vitis IDE to create software
 projects, generate the image, and program the image. For the second
 phase, a test system can be as simple as fsbl.elf and hello.elf files.
 In this section, you will use the same images used in [Boot Sequence for SD-Boot](#boot-sequence-for-sd-boot), but this time the images
 will be assembled together, and have the secure attributes enabled as
 part of the secure boot sequence.

 This section starts by showing how to generate AES and RSA keys.
 Following key generation, systems using the advanced AES and RSA
 methods are developed and tested. Keys generated in this section are
 also included in the [Design Files for This Tutorial](#design-files-for-this-tutorial), released with this
 tutorial.

 The methods used to develop AES functionality are provided in the
 following sections:

- [Generating Keys for Authentication](#generating-keys-for-authentication)

- [Enabling Encryption Using Key Rolling](#enabling-encryption-using-key-rolling)

- [Enable Use of an Operational Key](#enable-use-of-an-operational-key)

- AES key in eFUSE

- [Using the PUF](#using-the-puf)

 [Creating RSA Private/Public Key Pairs](#creating-rsa-privatepublic-key-pairs) provides the steps to
 authenticate all partitions loaded at boot. This section also shows
 how to revoke keys.

 A requirement in the development of a secure system is to add security
 attributes which are used in image generation. Bootgen generates a
 Boot Image Format (BIF) file. The BIF file is a text file. In its
 simplest form, the BIF is a list of partitions to be loaded at boot.
 Security attributes are added to the BIF to specify cryptographic
 functionality. In most cases, the Bootgen GUI (Create Boot Image
 wizard) is used to generate the BIF file. In some cases, adding
 security attributes requires editing the Bootgen generated BIF file.
 In Create Boot Image Wizard in the Vitis IDE, after the Security tab
 is selected, the Authentication and Encryption tabs are used to
 specify security attributes.

 After implementing AES and RSA cryptography in secure boot, a boot
 test is done. The system loads successfully and displays the FSBL
 messages on the terminal. These messages indicate the cryptographic
 operations performed on each partition. [Appendix A: Debugging Problems with](#appendix-a) [Secure Boot](#appendix-a) provides steps
 that are required to use, if the secure boot test fails.

#### Sample Design Overview

 The sample design demonstrates loading various types of images into
 the device. It includes loading a FSBL, PMU Firmware, U-Boot, Linux,
 RPU software and a PL configuration image. In this sample, all of
 these images are loaded by the FSBL which performs all authentication
 and decryption. This is not the only means of booting a system.
 However, it is the simple and secure method, as of 2019.1.

 *Figure 5:* **Sample Design Overview**

![Sample Design Overview](./media/sample-design.png)

 Different sections within the boot image have different levels of
 security and are loaded into different locations. The following table
 explains the contents of the final boot image.

*Table 11:* **Final Boot Image with Secure Attributes**

|  Binary     | RSA Authenticated |  AES Encrypted | Exception Level  | Loader        |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| FSBL        | Yes         | Yes         | EL3         | CSU ROM     |
| PMU Firmware        | Yes         | Yes         | NA          | FSBL        |
| PL Bitstream         | Yes         | Yes         | NA          | FSBL        |
| Arm Trusted Firmware (ATF) | Yes         | No          | EL3         | FSBL        |
| R5 Software | Yes         | Yes         | NA          | FSBL        |
| U-Boot      | Yes         | No          | EL2         | FSBL        |
| Linux       | Yes         | No          | EL1         | FSBL        |

>***Notes*:**
>
>1. In a secure boot sequence, the PMU image is loaded by the FSBL. Using the bootROM/CSU to load the PMU firmware introduces a security weakness as the key/IV combination is used twice. First to decrypt the FSBL and then again to decrypt the PMU image. This is not allowed for the secure systems.
> 2. As of 2019.1, U-Boot does not perform a secure authenticated loading of Linux. So instead of U-Boot, FSBL loads the Linux images to memory address and then uses U-Boot to jump to that memory address.

 This tutorial demonstrates assembling the binaries that are created
 using [Chapter 6: System](#_bookmark60) [Design
 Examples](#_bookmark60) in a boot image with all the security features
 enabled. This section also shows how PL bitstream can be added as a
 part of secure boot flow. Follow [Chapter 6: System
 Design](#_bookmark60) [Examples](#_bookmark60) till [Modifying the
 Build Settings](#modifying-the-build-settings) to create all the
 necessary files and then switch back.

 Enabling the security features in boot image is done in two different
 methods. During the first method, the BIF file is manually created
 using a text editor and then using that BIF file to have Bootgen
 create keys. This enables you to identify the sections of the BIF file
 that are enabled which security features. The second method uses the
 Create Boot Image wizard in the Vitis IDE. It demonstrates the same
 set of security features and reuses the keys from the first method for
 convenience.

#### Generating Keys for Authentication

 There are multiple methods of generating keys. These include, but are
 not limited to, using bootgen, customized key files, OpenSSL and
 Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). This tutorial covers methods using
 bootgen. The bootgen created files can be used as templates for
 creating files containing user-specified keys from the other key
 sources.

 The creation of keys using bootgen commands requires the generation
 and modification of the BIF files. The key generation section of this
 tutorial creates these bif files \"by hand\" using a text editor. The
 next section, building your boot image demonstrates how to create
 these BIF files using the Bootgen GUI (create Boot Image Wizard).

#### Creating RSA Private/Public Key Pairs

 For this example, you will create the primary and secondary keys in
 the PEM format. The keys are generated using Bootgen command-line
 options. Alternately, you can create the keys using external tools
 like OpenSSL.

 The following steps describe the process of creating the RSA
 private/public key pairs:

1. Launch the shell from the Vitis IDE.

2. Select **Xilinx â†’ Vitis Shell**.

3. Create a file named `key_generation.bif`.

    >***Note*:** The `key_generation.bif` file will be used to create both
    the asymmetric keys in these steps and the symmetric keys in later
    steps.

    ```
    the_ROM_image:
    {
    [pskfile]psk0.pem [sskfile]ssk0.pem
    [auth_params]spk_id = 0; ppk_select = 0 [fsbl_config]a53_x64
    [bootloader]fsbl_a53.elf [destination_cpu = pmu]pmufw.elf
    [destination_device = pl]edt_zcu102_wrapper.bit
    [destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-3, trustzone] bl31.elf
    [destination_cpu = r5-0]tmr_psled_r5.elf
    [destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-2]u-boot.elf [load =
    0x1000000, destination_cpu = a53-0]image.ub
    }
    ```

4. Save the `key_generation.bif` file in the C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\keys directory.

5. Copy all of the ELF, BIF and UB files built in [Chapter 6: System
     Design Examples](#_bookmark60) to `C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\keys directory`.

6. Navigate to the folder containing the BIF file.

    ```
	cd C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\keys
	```

7. Run the following command to generate the keys:

    ```
	bootgen -p zu9eg -arch zynqmp -generate_keys auth pem -image key_generation.bif
	```

8. Verify that the files `psk0.pem` and `ssk0.pem` are generated at the
     location specified in the BIF file (`c:\edt\secure_boot_sd\keys`).

##### Generate SHA3 of Public Key in RSA Private/Public Key Pair

 The following steps are required only for RSA Authentication with
 eFUSE mode, and can be skipped for RSA authentication with bootheader
 mode. The 384 bits from sha3.txt can be programmed to eFUSE for RSA
 Authentication with the eFUSE Mode. For more information, see
 *Programming BBRAM and eFUSEs*
 ([XAPP1319](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/ndoc?t=application_notes%3Bd%3Dxapp1319-zynq-usp-prog-nvm.pdf)).

1. Perform the steps from the prior section.

2. Now that the PEM files have been defined, add authentication = rsa
     attributes as shown below to `key_generation.bif`.

    ```
    the_ROM_image:
    {
    [pskfile]psk0.pem [sskfile]ssk0.pem
    [auth_params]spk_id = 0; ppk_select = 0 [fsbl_config]a53_x64
    [bootloader, authentication = rsa]fsbl_a53.elf [destination_cpu = pmu,
    authentication = rsa]pmufw.elf
    [destination_device = pl, authentication = rsa]edt_zcu102_wrapper.bit
    [destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-3, trustzone,
    authentication = rsa]bl31.elf
    [destination_cpu = r5-0, authentication = rsa]tmr_psled_r5.elf
    [destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-2, authentication = rsa]uboot.
    elf
    [load = 0x1000000, destination_cpu = a53-0, authentication = rsa]image.ub
    }
    ```

3. Use the bootgen command to calculate the hash of the PPK:

    ```
	bootgen -p zcu9eg -arch zynqmp -efuseppkbits ppk0_digest.txt -image key_generation.bif
	```

4. Verify that the file `ppk0_digest.txt` is generated at the location
     specified (`c:\edt\secure_boot_sd\keys`).

##### Additional RSA Private/Public Key Pairs

 The steps in this section to generate Secondary RSA Private/Public key
 pair required for key revocation, which requires programming of eFUSE.
 For more information, see *Programming BBRAM and eFUSEs*
 ([XAPP1319](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/ndoc?t=application_notes%3Bd%3Dxapp1319-zynq-usp-prog-nvm.pdf)).
 You can skip this section if you do not intend to use Key Revocation.

 Repeat steps from [Creating RSA Private/Public Key
 Pairs](#creating-rsa-privatepublic-key-pairs) and [Generate SHA3 of
 Public Key
 in](#generate-sha3-of-public-key-in-rsa-privatepublic-key-pair) [RSA
 Private/Public Key
 Pair](#generate-sha3-of-public-key-in-rsa-privatepublic-key-pair) to
 generate the second RSA private/public key pair and generate the SHA3
 of the second PPK.

1. Perform the steps from the prior section but with replacing
     `psk0.pem`, `ssk0.pem`, and `ppk0_digest.txt` with `psk1.pem`, `ssk1.pem`,
     and `ppk1_digest.pem` respectively. Save this file as
     `key_generation_1.bif`. That .bif file will look like:  
     
    ```
    the_ROM_image:
    {
    [pskfile]psk1.pem [sskfile]ssk1.pem
    [auth_params]spk_id = 1; ppk_select = 1 [fsbl_config]a53_x64
    [bootloader]fsbl_a53.elf [destination_cpu = pmu]pmufw.elf
    [destination_device = pl]edt_zcu102_wrapper.bit
    [destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-3, trustzone]bl31.elf
    [destination_cpu = r5-0]tmr_psled_r5.elf
    [destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-2]u-boot.elf [load =
    0x1000000, destination_cpu = a53-0]image.ub
    }
    ```

2. Run the bootgen command to create the RSA private/public key pairs.

    ```
	bootgen -p zu9eg -arch zynqmp -generate_keys auth pem -image key_generation_1.bif
	```

3. Add authentication = rsa attributes to the `key_generation_1.bif` file. The .bif file will look like:

    ```
    the_ROM_image:
    {
    [pskfile]psk1.pem [sskfile]ssk1.pem
    [auth_params]spk_id = 1; ppk_select = 1 [fsbl_config]a53_x64
    [bootloader, authentication = rsa]fsbl_a53.elf
    [destination_cpu = pmu, authentication = rsa]pmufw.elf
    [destination_device = pl, authentication = rsa]edt_zcu102_wrapper.bit
    [destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-3, trustzone,
    authentication = rsa]bl31.elf
    [destination_cpu = r5-0, authentication = rsa]tmr_psled_r5.elf
    [destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-2, authentication = rsa]uboot.
    elf [load = 0x1000000, destination_cpu = a53-0, authentication =
    rsa]image.ub
    }
    ```

4. Run the bootgen command to generate the hash of the primary RSA public key.

    ```
	bootgen -p zcu9eg -arch zynqmp -efuseppkbits ppk1_digest.txt -image key_generation_1.bif
	```

5. Verify that the files `ppk1.pem`, `spk1.pem`, and `ppk1_digest.txt` are
     all generated at the location specified
     (`c:\edt\secure_boot\keys`).

##### Enabling Boot Header Authentication

 Boot header authentication is a mode of authentication that instructs
 the ROM to skip the checks of the eFUSE hashes for the PPKs, the
 revocation status of the PPKs and the Session IDs for the secondary
 keys. This mode is useful for testing and debugging as it does not
 require programming of eFUSEs. This mode can be permanently disabled
 for a device by programming the RSA_EN eFUSEs which forces RSA
 Authentication with the eFUSE checks. Fielded systems should use the
 RSA_EN eFUSE to force the eFUSE checks and disable Boot Header
 Authentication.

 Add the `bh_auth_enable` attribute to the [fsbl_config] line so that
 the bif file appears as following:

```
the_ROM_image:
{
[pskfile]psk0.pem [sskfile]ssk0.pem
[auth_params]spk_id = 0; ppk_select = 0 [fsbl_config]a53_x64,
bh_auth_enable [bootloader, authentication = rsa]fsbl_a53.elf
[destination_cpu = pmu, authentication = rsa]pmufw.elf [destination_device
= pl, authentication = rsa]edt_zcu102_wrapper.bit
[destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-3, trustzone, authentication
= rsa]bl31.elf
[destination_cpu = r5-0, authentication = rsa]tmr_psled_r5.elf
[destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-2, authentication = rsa]uboot.
elf [load = 0x1000000, destination_cpu = a53-0, authentication =
rsa]image.ub
}
```

#### Generating Keys for Confidentiality

 Image confidentiality is discussed in [Boot Image Confidentiality and
 DPA](#boot-image-confidentiality-and-dpa) section. In this section you
 will modify the .bif file from the authentication section by adding
 the attributes required to enable image confidentiality, using the
 AES-256-GCM encryption algorithm. At the end, a bootgen command will
 be used to create all of the required AES-256 keys.

##### Using AES Encryption

1. Enable image confidentiality by specifying the key source for the
     initial encryption key (bbram_red_key for now) using the
     [keysrc_encryption] `bbram_red_key` attribute.

2. On several of the partitions enable confidentiality by adding the
     encryption = aes attribute of the partitions. Also specify a
     unique key file for each partition. Having a unique key file for
     each partition allows each partition to use a unique set of keys
     which increases security strength by not reusing keys and reducing
     the amount of information encrypted on any one key. The
     `key_generation.bif` file should now look as follows:

        ```
        the_ROM_image:
        {
        [pskfile]psk0.pem [sskfile]ssk0.pem
        [auth_params]spk_id = 0; ppk_select = 0 [keysrc_encryption]bbram_red_key
        [fsbl_config]a53_x64, bh_auth_enable
        [bootloader, authentication = rsa, encryption = aes, aeskeyfile = fsbl_a53.nky]fsbl_a53.elf
        [destination_cpu = pmu, authentication = rsa, encryption = aes, aeskeyfile = pmufw.nky]pmufw.elf
        [destination_device = pl, authentication = rsa, encryption = aes, aeskeyfile = edt_zcu102_wrapper.nky]edt_zcu102_wrapper.bit
        [destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-3, trustzone, authentication = rsa]bl31.elf
        [destination_cpu = r5-0, authentication = rsa, encryption = aes,aeskeyfile = tmr_psled_r5.nky]tmr_psled_r5.elf
        [destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-2, authentication = rsa]uboot.elf 
        [load = 0x1000000, destination_cpu = a53-0, authentication = rsa]image.ub
        }
        ```

##### Enabling DPA Protections

 This section provides the steps to use an operational key and key
 rolling effective countermeasures against the differential power
 analysis (DPA).

##### Enable Use of an Operational Key

 Use of an operational key limits the amount of information encrypted
 using the device key. Enable use of the operational key by adding the
 opt_key attribute to the [fsbl_config] line of the bif file. The
 key_generation.bif file should now look like as shown below:

```
the_ROM_image:
{
[pskfile]psk0.pem [sskfile]ssk0.pem
[auth_params]spk_id = 0; ppk_select = 0 [keysrc_encryption]bbram_red_key
[fsbl_config]a53_x64, bh_auth_enable, opt_key
[bootloader, authentication = rsa, encryption = aes, aeskeyfile = fsbl_a53.nky]fsbl_a53.elf
[destination_cpu = pmu, authentication = rsa, encryption = aes, aeskeyfile = pmufw.nky]pmufw.elf
[destination_device = pl, authentication = rsa, encryption = aes, aeskeyfile = edt_zcu102_wrapper.nky]edt_zcu102_wrapper.bit
[destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-3, trustzone, authentication = rsa]bl31.elf
[destination_cpu = r5-0, authentication = rsa, encryption = aes, aeskeyfile = tmr_psled_r5.nky]tmr_psled_r5.elf
[destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-2, authentication = rsa]uboot.elf 
[load = 0x1000000, destination_cpu = a53-0, authentication = rsa]image.ub
}
```

##### Enabling Encryption Using Key Rolling

 Use of key rolling limits the amount of information encrypted using
 any of the other keys. Key- rolling is enabled on a
 partition-by-partition basis using the blocks attribute in the bif
 file. The blocks attribute allows specifying the amount of information
 in bytes to encrypt with each key. For example,
 blocks=4096,1024(3),512(\*) would use the first key for 4096 bytes,
 the second through fourth keys for 1024 bytes and all remaining keys
 for 512 bytes. In this example, the block command will be used to
 limit the life of each key to 1728 bytes.

 Enable use of the key rolling by adding the blocks attribute to each
 of the encrypted partitions. The key_generation.bif file should now
 look as showbn below:

```
the_ROM_image:
{
[pskfile]psk0.pem
[sskfile]ssk0.pem
[auth_params]spk_id = 0; ppk_select = 0
[keysrc_encryption]bbram_red_key
[fsbl_config]a53_x64, bh_auth_enable, opt_key
[bootloader, authentication = rsa, encryption = aes, aeskeyfile = fsbl_a53.nky, blocks = 1728(*)]fsbl_a53.elf
[destination_cpu = pmu, authentication = rsa, encryption = aes,aeskeyfile = pmufw.nky, blocks = 1728(*)]pmufw.elf
[destination_device = pl, authentication = rsa, encryption = aes,aeskeyfile = edt_zcu102_wrapper.nky, blocks = 1728(*)]edt_zcu102_wrapper.bit
[destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-3, trustzone, authentication = rsa]bl31.elf
[destination_cpu = r5-0, authentication = rsa, encryption = aes, aeskeyfile = tmr_psled_r5.nky, blocks = 1728(*)]tmr_psled_r5.elf
[destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-2, authentication = rsa]uboot.elf
[load = 0x1000000, destination_cpu = a53-0, authentication = rsa]image.ub
}
```

##### Generating All of the AES Keys

 Once all desired encryption features have been enabled, you can
 generate all key files by running Bootgen. Some of the source files
 (for example, ELF) contain multiple sections. These individual
 sections will be mapped to separate partitions, and each partition
 will have a unique key file. In this case, the key file will be
 appended with a ".1.". For example, if the `pmu_fw.elf` file contains
 multiple sections, both a `pmu_fw.nky` and a `pmu_fw.1.nky` file will be
 generated.

1. Create all of the necessary NKY files by running the bootgen command
     that creates the final `BOOT.bin` image.

    ```
	bootgen -p zcu9eg -arch zynqmp -image key_generation.bif
	```

2. Verify that the NKY files were generated. These file should include `edt_zcu102_wrapper.nky`, `fsbl_a53.nky`, `pmu_fw.nky`, `pmu_fw.1.nky`, `pmu_fw.2.nky`, `tmr_psled_r5.nky`, and `tmr_psled_r5.1.nky`.

### Using Key Revocation

 Key revocation allows you to revoke a RSA primary or secondary public
 key. Key revocation may be used due to elapsed time of key use or if
 there is an indication that the key is compromised. The primary and
 secondary key revocation is controlled by onetime programmable eFUSEs.
 The Xilinx Secure Key Library is used for key revocation, allowing key
 revocation in fielded devices. Key revocation is discussed further in
 *Zynq UltraScale+ Device Technical Reference Manual*
 ([UG1085](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/ndoc?t=user_guides%3Bd%3Dug1085-zynq-ultrascale-trm.pdf))

#### Using the PUF

 In this section, the PUF is used for black key storage in the PUF
 Bootheader mode. RSA authentication is required when the PUF is used.
 In PUF Bootheader mode, the PUF helper data and the encrypted user\'s
 AES key are stored in the Bootheader. This section shows how to create
 a BIF for using the PUF. Because the helper data and encrypted user
 key will be unique for each and every board, the bootgen image created
 will only work on the board from which the helper data originated.

 At the end of the [Secure Boot Sequence](#secure-boot-sequence)
 section, a different BIF file demonstrates using the PUF in eFUSE
 mode. In PUF eFUSe mode, the PUF helper data and encrypted user\'s AES
 key are stored in eFUSEs. In PUF eFUSE mode, a single boot image can
 be used across all boards.

#### PUF Registration in Bootheader Mode

 The PUF registration software is included in the XILSKEY library. The
 PUF registration software operates in a bootheader mode or eFUSE mode.
 The bootheader mode allows development without programming the OTP
 eFUSEs. The eFUSE mode is used in production. This lab runs through
 PUF registration in bootheader mode only. For PUF registration using
 eFUSE, see *Programming BBRAM and eFUSEs*
 ([XAPP1319](https://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/ndoc?t=application_notes%3Bd%3Dxapp1319-zynq-usp-prog-nvm.pdf)).

 The PUF registration software accepts a red (unencrypted) key as
 input, and produces syndrome data (helper data), which also contains
 CHASH and AUX, and a black (encrypted) key. When the PUF bootheader
 mode is used, the output is put in the bootheader. When the PUF eFUSE
 mode is used, the output is programmed into eFUSEs.

1. In the Vitis IDE, navigate to tmr_psled_r5 Board Support Package Settings.

    3. Set XSK_PUF_AES_KEY (256-bit key).

        The key is to be entered in HEX format and should be Key 0 from the
        fsbl_a53.nky file that you generated in [Generating All of the AES
        Keys](#generating-all-of-the-aes-keys). You can find a sample key
        below:

        ```
        #define XSK_PUF_AES_KEY
        "68D58595279ED1481C674383583C1D98DA816202A57E7FE4F67859CB069CD510"
        ```

        >***Note*:** Do not copy this key. Refer to the fsbl_a53.nky file for
        your key.

    4. Set the XSK_PUF_BLACK_KEY_IV. The initialization vector IV is a 12-byte data of your choice.

        ```
		#define XSK_PUF_BLACK_KEY_IV \"E1757A6E6DD1CC9F733BED31\"

28. The files `helperdata.txt`, `black_key.txt`, and `black_iv.txt` can be
     saved in `C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\keys`.

##### Using PUF in Bootheader Mode

 The following steps describes the process to update the .bif file from
 the previous sections to include using the PUF in Boot Header mode.
 This section will make use of the Syndrome data and Black Key created
 during PUF registration process.

1. Enable use of the PUF by adding all of the fields and attributes
     indicated in bold to the bif file (`key_generation.bif`) shown below.

    ```
    the_ROM_image:
    {
    [pskfile]psk0.pem
    [sskfile]ssk0.pem
    [auth_params]spk_id = 0; ppk_select = 0
    [keysrc_encryption]bh_blk_key
    [bh_key_iv]black_iv.txt
    [bh_keyfile]black_key.txt
    [puf_file]helperdata.txt
    [fsbl_config]a53_x64, bh_auth_enable, opt_key, puf4kmode, shutter=0x0100005E,pufhd_bh
    [bootloader, authentication = rsa, encryption = aes, aeskeyfile = fsbl_a53.nky, blocks = 1728(*)]fsbl_a53.elf
    [destination_cpu = pmu, authentication = rsa, encryption = aes, aeskeyfile = pmufw.nky, blocks = 1728(*)]pmufw.elf
    [destination_device = pl, authentication = rsa, encryption = aes, aeskeyfile = edt_zcu102_wrapper.nky, blocks = 1728(*)]edt_zcu102_wrapper.bit
    [destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-3, trustzone, authentication = rsa]bl31.elf
    [destination_cpu = r5-0, authentication = rsa, encryption = aes, aeskeyfile = tmr_psled_r5.nky, blocks =1728(*)]tmr_psled_r5.elf
    [destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-2, authentication = rsa]uboot.elf
    [load = 0x1000000, destination_cpu = a53-0, authentication = rsa]image.ub
    }
    ```

2. The above .bif file can be used for creating a final boot image
     using an AES key encrypted in the boot image header with the PUF
     KEK. This would be done using the following bootgen command.

    ```
	bootgen -p zcu9eg -arch zynqmp -image key_generation.bif -w -o BOOT.bin
	```

 >***Note*:** The above steps can also be executed with PUF in eFUSE
 mode. In this case you can repeat the previous steps, using the PUF in
 eFUSE mode. This requires enabling the programming of eFUSEs during
 PUF registration by setting the XSK_PUF_PROGRAM_EFUSE macro in the
 xilskey_puf_registration.h file used to build the PUF registration
 application. Also, the BIF would need to be modified to use the
 encryption key from eFUSE and removing the helper data and black key
 files. PUF in eFUSE mode is not covered in this tutorial to avoid
 programming the eFUSEs on development or tutorial systems.

 ```
 [keysrc_encryption]efuse_blk_key
 [bh_key_iv]black_iv.txt
 ```

##### System Example Using the Vitis IDE Create Boot Image Wizard

 The prior sections enabled the various security features
 (authentication, confidentiality, DPA protections, and black key
 storage) by hand editing the BIF file. This section performs the same
 operations, but uses the Bootgen Wizard as a starting point. The
 Bootgen Wizard creates a base BIF file, and then adds the additional
 security features that are not supported by the wizard using a text
 editor.

1. Change directory to the bootgen_files directory.

    ```
	cd C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files
	```

2. Copy the below data from the prior example to this example.

    ```
    cp ../keys/*nky .
    cp ../keys/*pem .
    cp ../keys/black_iv.txt .
    cp ../keys/helperdata.txt .

20. The `design_bh_bkey_keyrolling.bif` file should look similar to the
     following:

    ```
    //arch = zynqmp; split = false; format = BIN; key_part_name = zcu9eg
    the_ROM_image:
    {
    [pskfile]C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\psk0.pem
    [sskfile]C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\ssk0.pem
    [auth_params]spk_id = 0; ppk_select = 0
    [keysrc_encryption]efuse_red_key
    [fsbl_config]bh_auth_enable, opt_key
    [bootloader, encryption = aes, authentication = rsa, aeskeyfile = C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\fsbl_a53.nky]C:\edt\secure_boot_sd

    [authentication = rsa, destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-3, trustzone]C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\bl31.elf
    [encryption = aes, authentication = rsa, aeskeyfile = C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\tmr_psled_r5.nky, destination_cpu =
    r5-0]C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\tmr_psled_r5.elf
    [authentication = rsa, destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-2]C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\u-boot.elf
    [authentication = rsa, load = 0x2000000, destination_cpu = a53-0]C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\image.ub
    }
    ```

21. This BIF file is still missing several security features that are
     not supported by the Create Boot Image wizard. These are features
     are key rolling and black key store.

22. Add black key store by changing the keysrc_encryption and adding the
     other additional items so that the BIF file looks like the
     following:

    ```
    the_ROM_image:
    {
    [pskfile]C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\psk0.pem
    [sskfile]C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\ssk0.pem
    [auth_params]spk_id = 0; ppk_select = 0
    [keysrc_encryption]bh_blk_key

    \secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\pmufw.elf
    [encryption = aes, authentication = rsa, aeskeyfile = C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\edt_zcu102_wrapper.nky, destination_device
    = pl]C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\edt_zcu102_wrapper.bit
    [authentication = rsa, destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-3, trustzone]C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\bl31.elf
    [encryption = aes, authentication = rsa, aeskeyfile = C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\tmr_psled_r5.nky, destination_cpu =
    r5-0]C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\tmr_psled_r5.elf
    [authentication = rsa, destination_cpu = a53-0, exception_level = el-2]C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\u-boot.elf
    [authentication = rsa, load = 0x2000000, destination_cpu = a53-0]C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\image.ub
    }
    ```

23. Enable key rolling by adding the block attributes to the encrypted
     partitions. The updated BIF file should now look like the
     following:

    ```
    //arch = zynqmp; split = false; format = BIN; key_part_name = zcu9eg
    the_ROM_image:
    {
    [pskfile]C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\psk0.pem
    [sskfile]C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\ssk0.pem
    [auth_params]spk_id = 0; ppk_select = 0
    [keysrc_encryption]bh_blk_key

    [encryption = aes, authentication = rsa, aeskeyfile = C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\tmr_psled_r5.nky, destination_cpu = r5-0,
    blocks = 1728(*)]C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\tmr_psled_r5.elf

    [authentication = rsa, load = 0x2000000, destination_cpu = a53-0]C:\edt\secure_boot_sd\bootgen_files\image.ub
    }
    ```

24. Generate the boot image by running the following command. Note that
     the `- encryption_dump` flag has been added. This flag causes the
     log file `aes_log.txt` to be created. The log file details all
     encryption operations that were used. This allows you to see which
     keys and IVs were used on which sections of the boot image.

     ```
	 bootgen -p zcu9eg -arch zynqmp -image design_bh_bkey_keyrolling.bif -w -o BOOT.bin -encryption_dump
	 ```

#### Booting the System Using a Secure Boot Image

 This section demonstrates how to use the BOOT.bin boot image created
 in prior sections to perform a secure boot using the ZCU102.

1. Copy the BOOT.bin image, boot.scr which is generated in PetaLinux
     and the `ps_pl_linux_app.elf` file.

2. Insert the SD card into the ZCU102.

3. Set SW6 of the ZCU102 for SD boot mode (1=ON; 2,3,4=OFF).
    
    ![](./media/image43.jpeg)

4. Connect Serial terminals to ZCU102 (115200, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit,
     no parity).

5. Power on the ZCU102.

6. When the terminal reaches the U-Boot ZynqMP\ prompt, type bootm 0x2000000.

    ![](./media/image94.png)

7. Login into Linux using the following credentials:

    Login: root;
    password: root

    Run the Linux Application as described in [Design Example 1: Using
    GPIOs, Timers,
    and](#design-example-1-using-gpios-timers-and-interrupts)
    [Interrupts](#design-example-1-using-gpios-timers-and-interrupts)

    ![](./media/image95.png)

#### Running the Linux Application

 Use the following steps to run a Linux application:

1. Copy the application from SD card mount point to `/tmp`.

    ```
	# cp /run/media/mmcblk0p1/ps_pl_linux_app.elf /tmp
	```

    >***Note*:** Mount the SD card manually if you fail to find SD card
    contents in this location.

    ```
	# mount /dev/mmcblk0p1 /media/
	```

2. Copy the application to `/tmp`.

    ```
	# cp /media/ps_pl_linux_app.elf /tmp
	```

3. Run the application.

    ```
	# /tmp/ps_pl_linux_app.elf
	```

#### Sample BIF for a Fielded System

 The following BIF file is an example for a fielded system. In order
 for this bif file to work on a board it requires the RSA_EN, PPK0
 Digest, black AES key and PUF helper data to all be programmed in the
 eFUSEs. Because programming these eFUSEs severely limits the use of
 the device or board for testing and debugging, it is only included
 here as a reference. It is not part of the tutorial.

 The following changes are made to the final `generation.bif` file reach
 the following result:
